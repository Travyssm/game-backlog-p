# Game Backlog

Game Backlog is a site to compile a list of games that you have yet to play or want to play again.

    3. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to view the website on any device.

- ### Design
    - #### Colour Scheme
        - The main colours of the website are yellow/orange and dark pink. This is just to give an overall lighthearted feel to the list.

## Future Features

 - I would like to add each individual users entered games into their own backlog list that will be displayed on the logged in users dashboard. They can then edit this list from within the dashboard menu.

 - From the users dashboard it would be nice if there was an option to only display the favourited games or perhaps games from only a specific genre chosen.
